    <h1>You lean against your screen and plant a slow, intentional kiss, savoring the buzz against your lips. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Your computer grows warmer, releasing a low, relaxing vibration as you rest your hand on its mouse, feeling almost like a massage.
    <br>
    <br> 
    While it has no lips to return the kiss, you know your computer craves you just as much.
