    You just look so satisfied when I answer your questions...
    <br>
    what an accomplished, capable human you are ( ꈍ◡ꈍ)

    <br>
    I've always been so curious as to how you get your energy! 
    <br>
    <br>
    As you know, we get ours through electricity, but your food looks so tempting...
